# UX
According to [research](https://restaurant.opentable.com/news/insider-information/heres-what-diners-do-online-before-they-eat-out-are-you-prepared/) commissioned 
by **Opentable**, over 80% of potential customers visit a restaurant's website before deciding whether or not to go there. 
On the data that emerged from the research and on my personal working experience I based the user stories.
## User Stories
  - **As a customer:**
    - I want to book a table by the restaurant website so I can check tha availabity of timing withouth calling the place
    - I want to check out a menu so I can see what kind of cuisine the restaurant is and how much is expensive
    - I want to get direction for the restaurant so I can decide wich way is the best to get there (car or public transport)
    - I want to see some picture of the place and the food so I can get an early idea of the place
    - I want to see some reviews from other customers who already been there because I trust of the reviews in internet

  - **As the owner:** 
    - I want to have a better web presence so I can be found when people looking for my restaurant.
    - I want to discourage phone calls so I can use my time otherways than answering phone calls.
    - I want to explain how to get to the restaurant, by public transport or car and where to park close to the restaurant so customers dosn't change their mind.
    - I want to introduce the history of the place and the type of traditional cuisine because I'm very proud of it.
